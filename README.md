Tenyks
======

Tenyks is a (soon to be) really smart, service oriented, IRC bot.

# Install Him

These are just development installation instructions. Production will come
soon when I am happy with it.

`mkvirtualenvwrapper tenyks`
`git clone https://github.com/kyleterry/tenyks.git`
`python setup.py develop`
`cp tenyks/settings.py{,dist}`
`vim tenyks/settings.py # edit everything that makes sense to edit`
`python tenyks/core.py`
