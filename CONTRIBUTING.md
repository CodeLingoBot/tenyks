# Contributing

I would love help with this. I really want to make Tenyks a robust, easy to use
and fun IRC bot full of rich services. Part of the fun is anyone can write a
service in the language of their choice. If you are a lisper, you can use Common
Lisp or Clojue. If you are a pythonista or a rubist, You can use one of those
languages.

If you would like to contribute to Tenyks, please make pull requests or file bug
reports with features requests and issues.

If you do file a pull request that fixes a bug, please make the commit message
[thorough and explain why the bug was
fixed](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
I love learning through critique and I'm very open to it.

Please feel free to add your name to [AUTHORS.md](./AUTHORS.md) if you make a
patch.
